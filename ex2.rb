# Study Drills
# 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does. Yes
# 2-4. Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, 
#      and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed. Fix any error you find.
#      Now read aloud including saying each character. If more errors found, fix them.
