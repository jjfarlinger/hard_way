#Exercise 22: What do You Know So far. Make a list of the words and symbols you have used thusfar.
#Write what that word/symbol does next to it.

#     puts = prints a string to screen and create new line.
#     # octothorpe is used to make comments. Anything typed after # on the line is ignored.
#     + plus (addition)
#     + Also used for string concatenation.
#     - minus (subtraction)
#     / slash (divide)
#     * asterisk (multiply)
#     % percent (mod operator)
#     <less-than
#     greater-than
#     <= less-than-equal
#     >= greater-than-equal
#     #{var} used to populate variable values into a string.
#     variable - used to store values
#     = assignment operator - assigns value Ex: myVar = 35. myVar now holds value of 35.
#     print = prints to screen but does not add a carriage return at the end like puts
#     \n adds a new line/carriage return.
#     %{var} Used when you want to apply the same format to multiple values.
#     """ Multi line string """
#     \ backslash is used to escape. Used to escape symbols.
#     \t tab
#     \\ Backslash ()
#     \' Single-quote (')
#     \" double-quote (")
#     \a bell (BEL)
#     \b backspace (BS)
#     \f formfeed (FF)
#     \r Carriage Return (CR)
#     \uxxxx	Character with 16-bit hex value xxxx (Unicode only)
#     \v	vertical tab (VT)
#     \ooo	Character with octal value ooo
#     \xhh	Character with hex value hh
#     gets.chomp = Use to get user input (gets) and removes the newline (chomps)
#     gets.chomp.to_i Takes user input and converts to an integer
#     .to_f converts to float
#     ARGV The argument variable that holds the arguments you pass when you run the script.
#     $stdin input from the user given usually stored in a variable.
#     open command to open a file
#     read command to read/print the file
#     close command to close the file
#     seek command to locate a particular place (in bytes) in a file.
#     readline Reads just one line of a text file
#     truncate Empties the file. 
#     write('stuff') Writes (whatever is inside parenthesis) to the file.
#     File.exist? Checks to see if file exists
#     functions - Functions do three things: they name pieces of code, take arguments, and make mini-scripts
#     def - Defines a function (def hello(arg1, arg2))
#     *args is a lot like ARGV paramenter, but for functions def hello(*args) \n arg1, arg2 = args
#     Above not needed can do:  hello(arg1, arg2) which eliminates the second line above.
#     return Sets variables to be a value from a function
#     <<END is a "heredoc" or "here document" - used to create a multi-line string. You can use anyword to declare it <<BIGDOC . . . . BIGDOC
